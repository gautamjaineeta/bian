   Spring Boot
   Spring Reactive
   H2 Database.
   
   Based on the scope of project, I started using spring reactive which provides option to streaming data asynchronously as data is avaliable in database if data base supports asynchronous query.
   
   I am using H2 database for the demo purpose, which does not support asynchronous results yet.
